# Scoreboard
This project is a Scoreboard with Among Us theme, designed to display information about our players in a school game. To achieve this, the scoreboard will operate on a web page.
The technologies used in this project include: HTML to display the user interface; Pyhon for real-time database connectivity and an external button programmed to trigger the start and stop feature each round.
